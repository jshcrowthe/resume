# Resume

This is the source code for my resume, it is created using pandoc and by following the blogpost here: https://blog.chmd.fr/editing-a-cv-in-markdown-with-pandoc.html

It has three dependencies:

1. make
1. pandoc
1. wkhtmltopdf

You can install the last two via homebrew

```shell
brew install pandoc
brew cask install wkhtmltopdf
```

Once that is good to go just run `make` and you're good to go!
