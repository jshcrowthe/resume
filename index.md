## Summary

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for the Web. I strive to develop performant, modular, well tested code, at a rapid pace, and am constantly iterating to make it better. I also enjoy contributing to open source projects with contributions to libraries like Firebase, Webpack, Polymer and others. I have developed software using all of the following technologies/frameworks: Node.js, Polymer WebComponents, Angular.js, Express.js, Redis, MongoDB, Mocha, Karma, PHP, Wordpress, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## Experience

February 2017 - Present  
:   **Software Engineer** at Google

    As Technical Lead of the Firebase JSCore team, I was in charge of several high profile projects across the Firebase Web Landscape, including:

    - **Web SDK Open Sourcing**  
      I was responsible for building the infrastructure for open sourcing the Firebase Web SDK. I designed and implemented build/test processes for each component using open source tooling, and guided each of the component teams in their own implementation/integration efforts. This project was a main deliverable for Google I/O 2017. 
    - **Monorepo SDK Structure**  
      I redesigned the component interactions and isolated each components build/test systems in a "monorepo" style. This work improved build/test times, reduced friction between teams, and increased developer velocity by reducing component coupling, improving package discoverability, and better optimizing available tooling. (See: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/171)
    - **Owner/Maintainer of `@firebase/app`**  
      As owner of the central integration point for all Firebase components, I designed and implemented support for "lazy loading" of individual Firebase SDKs. This feature improved app start times by as much as ~1 second, and  best practices in web development. Additionally I consolidated many of the utilities being used across the SDKs into common libraries to help improve overall developer experience and reduce the performance impact on applications.
    - **SDK Release Tooling/Ownership**  
      This project was an ongoing effort to release high quality SDKs to users through multiple distribution channels. I designed and created the tooling that is used to run weekly releases (both staging and production) and ship code to NPM, Google CDNs, and Bower. These packages see >600,000 downloads a month and are released on a weekly basis with minimal impact.

September 2015 - January 2017  
:   **Web Developer (Technical Lead)** at FamilySearch

    - **Tree Team**  
      Responsible for re-architecting a web component based implementation of the tree product, one of FamilySearch's most critical user experiences. Led architectural discussions as well as implementation of an offline, mobile first, progressive web application.

      Also helped lead the organization's efforts in training on modern web standards. Sample topics include: web components, fetch, functional programming, functional reactive programming (streams), service worker, and others.
    - **Memories Team**  
      Responsible for investigating web components as a potential technology at FamilySearch. Led development of the Memories gallery, a 100% web component based project, which served as a pioneer for the web components initiative.

      Leveraged web components to reduce the download size of many of our shared components. In some modules saving as much as 100kb in unneeded page weight.

January 2015 - April 2015  
:   **MEAN Stack Instructor** at Coding Campus

    Main Instructor for Coding Campus' first MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) course. Worked with other instructors to develop a curriculum to teach the MEAN stack. Taught students with varying levels of experience the following:

    - Introductory/Intermediate Javascript
    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - Angular.js
    - Node.js
    - Express
    - MongoDB
    - Mongoose

April 2014 - September 2014  
:   **Web Development Intern** at FamilySearch  

    Worked on the My Family Booklet team continuing development and maintenance on the Booklet project. Reduced average page load times by more than 20% with some users seeing an improvement of over 1.5 seconds.

    Utilized the following technologies:

    - Node.js
    - Express.js
    - Angular.js
    - Redis
